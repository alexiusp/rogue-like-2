# In the depths of Arsunn

This is an experimental pet-project implementing a "rogue-like" single-player RPG inspired by such games as ADoM, Mordor and Grim Quest.
Main reason to work on this project (besides having fun) is getting experience working on some modern web technologies, such as Vite, Effector etc.

The gameplay consists of two main parts (like in Mordor or Grim Quest): City and Dungeon. In the City character can restore health, refill supplies, buy new equipment or identify and sell loot gathered during delving into depth of the dungeon. In the dungeon character can explore the dungeon level looking for the entrance to the next level and fightin monsters on the way. Eventually there will be a level with "boss" which needs to be killed to complete the main quest, but there is no main quest yet :sweat_smile:.

## Plan of implementation

Currently there is no precise plan of implementation or release. Some ideas, known bugs and desired next steps are stored in [To Do](ToDo.md).
