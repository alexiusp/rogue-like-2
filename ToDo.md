# Ideas to be implemented (unsorted):

- Name generator (for character and guild masters)
- character avatar selection
  - improve save slots to include avatar as menu item icon
- Buffers or hotkeys - panel with quick access to spells/items
- Messages buffer - to describe events or battle log to use
- refactor battle to propagate dealt damage as event payload to properly display it
- magic/spells: need to design how to structure the data in a best way
- encounters:
  - chests: opened, locked, magically locked
  - lair
  - event: picture, text, actions with stat to do a check roll, consequenses as items, gold, xp, spells cast on character
- other terrains and effects
- time/move counter (for each tile) when player is in dungeon to respawn/regenerate dungeon tiles after timeout (before character enters is again? or in realtime)
- guild log - list of "events" happened with guild members, initialized with guild master takes the position
- global quest (story) - need to design how and when it should be triggered
- tavern quests (should be similar to quests from the guild)

# Next tasks (sorted):

- items identification
- health restoration in tavern
- add two more monsters and items
- leveling - hp/mp increase, attack/defense bonuses etc.
