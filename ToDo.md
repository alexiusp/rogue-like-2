# Ideas to be implemented (unsorted):

- Name generator (for character and guild masters)
- character avatar selection
- Buffers or hotkeys - panel with quick access to spells/items
- Messages buffer - to describe events or battle log to use
- refactor battle to propagate dealt damage as event payload to properly display it
- encounter: chests: opened, locked, magically locked
- encounter: lair
- other terrains and effects
- time/move counter (for each tile) when player is in dungeon to respawn/regenerate dungeon tiles after timeout (before character enters is again? or in realtime)
- guild log - list of "events" happened with guild members, initialized with guild master takes the position
- global quest (story) - need to design how and when it should be triggered

# Next tasks (sorted):

- items identification
- add two more monsters and items
- leveling - hp/mp increase, attack/defense bonuses etc.
