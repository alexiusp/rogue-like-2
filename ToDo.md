# Ideas to be implemented (unsorted):

- Name generator (for character and guild masters)
- character avatar selection
- Buffers or hotkeys - panel with quick access to spells/items
- Messages buffer - to describe events or battle log to use
- refactor battle to propagate dealt damage as event payload to properly display it
- encounter: chests: opened, locked, magically locked
- encounter: lair
- other terrains and effects
- time/move counter when in dungeon to respawn dungeon after timeout (before character enters is again)
- guild make level - hp/mp increase, attack/defense bonuses etc.
- items identification
